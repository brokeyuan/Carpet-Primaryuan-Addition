## Fake Player Pearl Teleport Commands

### /tpp - Fake Player Pearl Teleport

#### Syntax

```
/tpp <station>
```

#### Permission

Requires the `TppFakePlayer` rule to be enabled.

#### Description

Teleport to the specified station (relayed via a fake player).

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `station` | string | Target teleport station name (supports internal name or display name) |

#### Workflow

1. Build the fake player name: alias (if any) or player name (truncated to 10 characters) + `_` + station name
2. Execute `/player <fakePlayerName> rejoin` (have the existing fake player rejoin)
3. Poll and wait for the fake player to come online (up to 10 seconds)
4. Loop executing `/player <fakePlayerName> use` (the teleporter controls the fake player to right-click an ender pearl) based on the station-level use count (or the global default if not set), with a 0.5-second interval between each use
5. Wait 3 seconds for the teleport to complete
6. Execute `/player <fakePlayerName> kill` (remove the fake player)

#### Usage Examples

```bash
# Teleport to a station named spawn
/tpp spawn

# Teleport to a station named base
/tpp base
```

#### Permission

Most subcommands require administrator permission.

#### Description

#### Subcommands

  - `station` - Station name

##### `/tppset set <name> [<displayName>]`

##### `/tppset rule use <count> [station]`

Set the number of times the fake player right-clicks an ender pearl during teleport. You can omit `station` to set the global default, or specify `station` to set an independent count for that station (station-level takes precedence over global).

- **Permission**: Admin only
- **Parameters**:
  - `count` - Number of right-clicks (minimum 1)
  - `station` - Optional, station name (supports internal name or display name). When omitted, sets the global default; when specified, only applies to that station

##### `/tppset rule`

View the current TPP rule configuration.

- **Permission**: Admin only

#### Alias System Description

Administrators can set short aliases for players to build shorter fake player names and avoid exceeding the character limit.

```
Original: VeryLongPlayerName_station (may exceed the character limit)
Alias: VIP
Result: VIP_station (shorter and safe)
```

#### Usage Examples

```bash
# Add a station (no display name)
/tppset set spawn

# Add a station (with display name)
/tppset set farm 农场

# Remove a station
/tppset remove spawn

# Set an alias for a player
/tppset rename VeryLongPlayerName set VIP

# Remove a player alias
/tppset rename VeryLongPlayerName remove

# Set the global use count to 2
